# Starr Hill Pathways Longitudinal Research Project 
## Understanding Starr Hill Students' Experiences 
This repository contains the processes that the Education Research Team at the Center for Community
Partnerships undertakes to understand the lived experiences of Starr Hill Pathways students.
This process moves from protocol ideation, to data collection, to analysis and communication. 
In this repository, you can find the interview protocols, survey scales, and data scripts we
use to do this work. 

## How to use this repository
Protocols for interviews and survey collection exist in the "protocols" folder, split by which
type of research is being conducted. Protocols are named based on the year in which they were 
first created. 

Scripts for data cleaning and analysis exist under 'scripts'. Each year's survey collection has
it's own year folder, which will continue to be updated as more surveys are conducted. 

Both the raw data and the cleaned data have been omitted to protect student privacy.
